# SharpDistSensor
A library for the Arduino IDE that helps interface with Sharp analog distance sensors.  

Version 0.2.2  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DrGFreeman/SharpDistSensor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DrGFreeman/SharpDistSensor)  
By Julien de la Bru√®re-Terreault (drgfreeman@tuta.io)

## Summary
The analog value from the sensor is converted to distance using a polynomial fit curve up to fifth order.
The default polynomial coefficients in this lilbrary are calibrated for the Sharp GP2Y0A60SZLF Analog Distance Sensor 10-150cm, 5V over a range of 50-1500 mm (analog values 30-875). Returned distance units are millimeters (mm). For different accuracy, range, sensor model or units, different coefficients may be required.
The distance output is filtered using median filtering. MedianFilter class from the following library is used: https://github.com/daPhoosa/MedianFilter.

## Examples
Two example sketches are provided with the library.
* _SharpDistSensorBasic.ino_  
This example shows how to use the library with the default calibration curve for the Sharp GP2Y0A60SZLF 5V sensor.

* _SharpDistSensorCustom.ino_  
This example shows how to use the library with the a custom calibration curve.

## Library Reference
* `SharpDistSensor(const byte pin, const byte size = 1)`  
Constructor: `pin` is the analog pin to which the sensor is connected, `size` is the size of the median filter window and should be an odd positive integer (default = 1 = no filtering).  

* `uint16_t getDist()`  
Returns the measured distance. Distance units are in millimeters (mm) if using the library default settings. If using custom calibration, units depend on the calibration used.  

* `void setPolyFitCoeffs(const byte nbCoeffs, const float* coeffs, const uint16_t valMin, const uint16_t valMax)`  
Sets the polynomial fit curve coefficients C0 to C5 in the relation:  
_Distance = C0 + C1 * A + C2 * A^2 + ... + C5 * A^5_  
where A is the analog value read from the sensor. At least one coefficient must be provided and up to six maximum (5th order polynomial). `nbCoeffs` is the number of coefficients passed and `coeffs` a vector containing the coefficients (C0 to C5). `valMin` and `valMax` define the range of analog values for which the polynomial fit is valid. Analog values outside this range will be set to the respective min or max values.  

* `void setValMinMax(const uint16_t valMin, const uint16_t valMax)`  
Sets the range of analog values for which the polynomial fit is valid (`valMin` and `valMax`). Analog values outside this range will be set to the respective min or max values.
